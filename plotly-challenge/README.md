Belly Button Biodiveristy Analysis used an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet.

Plotly.js
This project used JavaScript, Plotly.js, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask to explore the Belly Button Biodiverisity dataset. The data was analyzed and then build three graphs using Plotly and Javascript. The bar chart shows the 10 ten bacteria found in the bully button swaps for a particular sample id. The bubble chart shows all the samples and OTU ID data points. Metadata for the sample is also displayed. The graphs resize when the page size is modified.

Code Files:
app.js - Contains the Javascript code that calls the functions to read and store the bio samples, OTU and metagata.

index.html - Contains the HTML code to display the webpage.
